# Tracking Gender Inquality in Employment Across Europe Using Visual Interactions on StreamLit

As a part of a final project we created a StreamLit application to visually track the inquality in gender specifically for European countries.

# How to Use the Tool:
When you first access the tool, you will see an opening page that displays the main theme of our tool. You can access the pages using the slider at the top which takes you to the next pages.

The tool is divided into two major pages, each of which highlights six key metrics 
that directly or indirectly reflect economic disparity in European countries. The 
indicators are:
1. Gender Wage Gap
2. Weeks of Maternal Leave
3. Weeks of Paternal Leave
4. Share of Female Managers
5. Share of Women Holding Seats in Parliaments
6. Share of Women Holding Seats on Boards of Publicly Listed Companies

## Page 1
The first page highlights the percentage of women across countries that have the power of decision making. This includes multiple filters as seen on the left based on board seats, seats in parliament etc.

</p>

Upon selecting a country on the map you can then see the exact percentage of women in power and if there has been an increase or decrease since the previous year

## Page 2
The second page teaches you how to add images to a graph on streamlit. As seen below, to compare the maternity and paternity leaves, I added the baby bottles to each bar of the bar plot.
